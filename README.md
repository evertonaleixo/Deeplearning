# Deeplearning
Studies in Deeplearing-area

In this repository I will put deeplearing research and tests. In general I will use python language. 

In the folder 'ConvolutionNet' I will explorer Deep Neural Network using convolutional network. The explanation is done in portugues, because there already exist many text in english, but almost anything in portugues.

In the folder 'TensorBoard' I will explore the the tensorboard, a web application that allows visualize data and models developed with tensorflow. It is great to understand your model and fix possible problems. In the internet has many resource in english, so it was written in portuguese.
